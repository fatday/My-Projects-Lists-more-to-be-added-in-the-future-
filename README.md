# Important Notes
## Due to the academic integrity from school and confidential information from company or research, I can only share some of my codes samples that are not from course assignments/projects, internship projects, research projects.

This repo will include:
1. OOP Course Final Project (C++)
2. Self-Similar Process Research Study Sample (Python)
3. Typed Course Notes and Research Study Notes



The following are the code samples that not be avaliable in this repo:

1. Data Structure and Algorithm Course Assignments (C/C++)
2. OOP Course Assignments (C++, bash)
3. Database Course Final Project (Java, SQL, Python)
4. Numercial Methods Course Project (Matlab)
5. Machine Learning Course Assignments (Python)
6. Neutrual Network Course Assignments (Python)
7. Statistical Learning Course Assignments (R, Python)
8. Optimization Course Project (Matlab)
9. Financial Math Course Assignments (Python)
10. UBS Quant Researcher Intern Project (python)
11. Scotiabank Quant Developer Intern Project (python)
12. Bayesian Statistics Research (R)
13. Image Caption Generator (Python, could generate the descriptrion of an image based on the input, but I lost the codes in my undergrad school server)
14. Customer Account Bank Management System (C, but I lost the codes in my undergrad school server)
